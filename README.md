This repository contains two codes to reproduce parts A and B of the figure in this reference:
N. Kravtsova. Note on a computational complexity of the Gromov-Wasserstein distance. 2024.  
https://arxiv.org/abs/2408.06525

Part A uses spaces constructed in Example 5.2 of this reference (no additional files are  needed when using the code):
Facundo Memoli. Gromov–Wasserstein distances and the metric approach to object matching. Foundations of computational mathematics, 11:417–487, 2011.
https://link.springer.com/content/pdf/10.1007/s10208-011-9093-5.pdf

Part B requires two data files - Lotka1.dat and Lotka2.dat. These data are constructed by simulating the model from this reference:
Dongmei Xiao and Wenxia Li. Limit cycles for the competitive three dimensional Lotka–Volterra system. Journal of Differential Equations, 164(1):1–15, 2000
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0022039699937294
The details on simulating this model are given in Section 3.1 and Figure 3 of this reference:
